# AtualizadorDeImpostosV2

This program is a tool that I made for working accountants in Brazil, in order to ease the task of accruals of unpaid taxes by Companies. 

It is designed especially for those utilizing Dominio Sistemas, for that it creates a text file with bookkeeping entries ready to be imported in said system.

It utilizes various methods and classes in order to structure a reliable and accurate system, faithful to Brazil's tax system.

The program asks what is the specific tax, date, value and other specific informations it needs in order to calculate the correct accruals.

The only maintenance required is the monthly update of a text file that imputs the Selic rate, that, in Brazil, is the rate that unpaid taxes are updated for their interest.

If you need my support for managing the tool, please contact me through brunook13@outlook.com, and I will be happy to help.

Cheers, Bruno.
